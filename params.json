{"name":"DatadumpTool","tagline":"A Python-based command-line utility for deploying, querying, and generating statistics from MongoDB datadumps.","body":"### What is the Datadump Tool?\r\nThis tool was developed to automate and accelerate the processing of data dumps from a MongoDB database.  It focuses on statistical analysis of the graph structure described in the data dumps.  \r\n\r\n### How do I use the tool?\r\n\r\nFirst, be sure to install the following third-party libraries, preferably in a [Python virtual environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs.html).\r\n\r\n#### Required Third-Party Libraries\r\n\r\n- pymongo\r\n- pygraph\r\n- networkx\r\n- numpy\r\n- scipy\r\n- matplotlib\r\n\r\nOnce all the required libraries are installed, execute the main script as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ python datadump_tool.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs the script is running, you will see the following prompt:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(datadump-tool) \r\n```\r\n\r\nYou may type 'help' at the prompt to see a list of the available commands:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(datadump-tool) help\r\n\r\nDocumented commands (type help <topic>):\r\n========================================\r\ngenerate_dump  load_dump  deploy_dump  clear_mongo  stats  print_root_node_data  print_authors \r\nfind_leaf_nodes  find_root_nodes  calc_graph_scc  show_types  exit\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Author\r\nPeter Gebhard (@pgebhard) developed this software while working on the [TrustForge](http://rtg.cis.upenn.edu/TrustForge/) project as part of [DARPA's](http://www.darpa.mil) [Adaptive Vehicle Make](http://www.darpa.mil/Our_Work/TTO/Programs/Adaptive_Vehicle_Make__\\(AVM\\).aspx) program. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
